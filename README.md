SNHU CS 300 DSA:  Analysis and Design 23EW5

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

The problem that was solved in the projects for this course was to create a project for ABC University (ABCU) to help their Computer Science advisors access course information for students.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

In this course, I approached the projects by breaking them down into smaller sections and writing pseudocode for each part. This approach enabled me to work on the project incrementally and receive feedback from the instructor throughout the process.

Data structures are important because they help organize and store data efficiently.  By understanding data structures, you can design better algorithms, solve problems more effectively, manage memory wisely, and create reusable code.  They are essential for optimizing performance and building robust software systems.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

I successfully tackled roadblocks encountered during activities and projects by diligently reviewing weekly feedback from the instructor and referring to the provided resources and materials for guidance in each module.  

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

Working on this project has highlighted the significance of having a clear understanding of the client's problem and planning the project thoroughly.  It has emphasized the need to address and solve all aspects of the problem comprehensively.  Furthermore, the project has underscored the importance of pseudocode, as it should closely resemble the actual code to ensure a smooth transition from planning to implementation.
  
How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

Working on this project has taught me to write programs that are easier to maintain, read, and adapt. I now focus on modular design, clear code with meaningful names, flexibility, and documentation. I also prioritize testing to ensure reliability and make modifications smoother. Overall, my work on this project has improved the quality and maintainability of my programs.
